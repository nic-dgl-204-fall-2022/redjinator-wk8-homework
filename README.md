## Pre-refecltion
So far it’s been good going through this material while I’m behind in JavaScript because I’m doing my work with express in JavaScripts at the same time and it’s been really good for seeing how the parts work from two different language concerning routing and http requests. 
Open questions right now, how often is this used for regular webpages/webapps that are intended to be used by desktop device? Is Ktor primarily used for mobile apps? Would it be something to look into when present technologies using JavaScript are arguably more mature for web development? Or is the mobile first mentality bridging that gap faster than I think it is?
I think these are questions I’m going to have to do some research on and doubt they will be answered during the tutorial, but you never know.

## During tutorial
There were no challenges during the tutorial as it was very clearly explained. But using a template language is something I’ve only really seen in PHP last year so it’s been a while. While it seems simple enough, I’m sure there is some complexities waiting to get me somewhere. Anyway, it just feels foreign right now, I’m sure I’ll get over it.

## After tutorial
I have no idea how I’m going to apply this to my independent dev. I’m going to be making a text-based game or at least try to. Maybe I’ll make it browser based? I’m not sure, but I’m going to do my best to build the game first and then figure out how to serve it. But yeah, I think that would be the most reasonable thing would be have it playable in the browser. HA, I could probably make html controls for it then so you wouldn’t have to type “North, south, east, west, etc…”. Hmm it would have to be a dynamic page and use templates for buttons for things like picking up items that are not present 100% of the time would need to appear only when valid, ideally anyway.
We’ll see, I need to get it working first.
Anyway, got a day to figure it out. Tally Hooo!
